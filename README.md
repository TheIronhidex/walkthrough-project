# Data analysis for newbies: the importance of thinking twice

This is a project based on a real technical test for a company. A short introduction of the background of the company and the expected objectives is given below according to the original statement of the exercise, although the purpose of this project will be to further analyze the data and to realise where the catches are.

## Introduction üöï

Let's suppose that the company's name was _Kuber_. Kuber is a french company oriented to the passengers transport, like Uber, Lyft or Cabify.

Their business identity was initially based on the use of luxury cars fueled by high octane gasoline; however nowadays they would like to explore potential fuel alternatives, if possible both cheaper and more respectful with the environment.   

##### Some information about the gas ‚õΩÔ∏è

"In case you didn't know, souped-up cars use high cetane gasolines like SP98 to avoid late/advance fuel injection (avoiding connecting rod knock), but we've also started to embrace fuels that add ethanol into their formulations, are cheaper and offer the same cetane number as more expensive gasoline."

##### The objective üìà

Can you help them finding the best fuel?  

###### The company provides you with a .csv / .xlsx containing information about several trips and their correspondent fuel consumption.


## Walkthrough üö©

The project consists of (1) a notebook with all the code and comments about the steps that were followed, and (2) a report showing the conclusions [currently in progress].
